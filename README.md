# home-automation-using-alexa
In this voice-controlled home automation project using an ESP8266 NodeMCU and Alexa, I've developed a system that enables intuitive control of various home appliances through voice commands. The ESP8266 NodeMCU serves as the central hub, connecting appliances to the internet and executing commands received from Alexa via a Wi-Fi connection. Relays or electronic components interface with the NodeMCU to control appliance activation. Alexa functions as the voice interface, interpreting user commands and sending them to the NodeMCU for execution. With internet connectivity and integration with Alexa, the system offers remote control capability and seamless interaction with other smart devices, providing convenience and flexibility in managing home appliances.
